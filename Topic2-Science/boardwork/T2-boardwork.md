# Boardwork for Day #2 - Science and the Scientific Method

>Draw scientific process on the board, and refer to that as we walk through these

## Case Study #1: Gastritis
**Gastritis:** Inflammation of the stomach lining  
**Ulcer:** Open wounds in the stomach lining. Very serious, lifelong pain and greatly increased rate of stomach cancer.

Conventional wisdom - gastritis and ulcers were caused by lifestyle: stress, alcohol, smoking, diet.

Conventional wisdom - stomaches are sterile due to their acidity (pH = 1.5-3.5)

**Observation:** In 1979, Robin Warren saw live bacteria in a biopsy from someone with gastritis.  

**Hypothesis:** The bacteria are a causal factor in gastritis (i.e, this was not just a coincidence).  

**Prediction #1:** Bacteria should be present in individuals with gastritis, and absent from those without it.  

>This was found to be the case  

**Prediction #2:** Antiobiotic treatment of individuals with gastritis should cur it.  

> This worked as well  

**Prediction #3:** Treating a healthy person with the bacteria (*Helicobacter pylori*) should cause gastritis.  

> Barry Marshall did this to himself, and it worked  

Published their work, has since been replicated many many times.  


## Case Study #2: Vaccines and Autism
In 1998 a paper as published in the journal *Lancet*, headed by Dr. Andrew Wakefield  
  - Reported on **12** patients with "regressive" autism: develop normally at first, then show losses in language and social skills over time.  
  - Delay raised suspicions about an environmental trigger  
  - **8** of the 12 children had received the MMR vaccine ~6.3 days before showing symptoms  
  - Wakefield called for the stop of vaccines  
  - Concerned parents started to speak out  

>What should be our hypotheses and predictions here?

Shortly after (1999) a group headed by Dr. Brent Taylor published a paper  
  - **293** cases of Autism  
  - No difference in age of onset of vaccinated *vs* non-vaccinated children  
  - No relationship between timing of vaccination and onset  
  - No evidence of autism rates increasing in association with vacciation practices  
  - Called link with MMR a "false hope"  

Became a "David & Goliath" battle of Wakefield and parents *vs* "big pharma"

Independent researchers in the UK, Canada, and Finland did not detect any association with between the MMR vaccint and autism.

Danish study of **~440,000** children who had received the MMR vaccine and **97,000** who did not  
  - No difference in the risk of autism  
  - No association between the age of vaccination and onset  
  - No association between time since vaccination and onset

>Where are we at with our scientific process?

This didn't slow the controversy, and vaccination rates went down  

Why can't anyone replicate Wakely's findings?  
  - Small sample size?  
  - $90,000 of research funds, and $750,000 of personal funds came from a law firm preparing to sue vaccination companies -> **conflict of interest?**  
  - Several children in the study were children of clients in the lawsuit -> biased (circular) sample  
  - Wakefield didn't tell journal or co-authors:  
    - 10 sought to have the paper retracted  
  - Wakefield found guilty of misconduct, and stripped of ability to practice medicine  
  - Paper retracted, called an "elaborate fraud"  

Still a big issue: Gallup poll in 2015 showing:   
  - 6% of American adults believe vaccines cause autism,  
  - 42% think they don't,  
  - 52% are unsure
