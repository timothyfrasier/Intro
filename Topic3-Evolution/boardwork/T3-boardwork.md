# Board work for Topic #3 - Evolution

### Evolution in biology vs everyday life

`[Frame 4]`  
**Daily Life:**  
Each computer/phone/thing does not evolve itself, but rather the *population* of things evolves as the instructions change.  


`[Frame 12]`  
**Biological Evolution:**  
Individuals themselves do not evolve, but rather *populations* of organisms evolve as instructions (DNA) change.  


### Case Study Discussion
> Chapter is on how Darwin and Wallace developed the theory of natural selection independently, although Wallace slightly later than Darwin.


**Darwin:**
- Raised believing in the "fixity of species"  
- Did not do well in school, but always had a keen interest in nature
  -  Parents wanted him to go to medical school, but didn't like the site of blood  
  - Was going to train to be a vicar (like a priest)  
- In 1831, at the age of 22, he had the opportunity to be a naturalist on board the *Beagle*  
  - Was meant to be a 3-year trip, but turned into 5 `[see slides]`
- For reading, he brought the 3-volume *Principles of Geology* by **Charles Lyell** `see slides`  
  - Major influence on Darwin's thinking  
  - 'The structures we see today are the results of gradual processes that are still acting today' (canyons, mountains, etc.)
- Was struck by many things that raised questions about the fixity of species  
  - Found fossils of many species that are now extinct  
    - If all species are created perfectly, why would they go extinct?  
  - Islands (most famously the Gal√°pagos) showed clear evidence that species changed `[see slides]`  
    - Explain how birds and tortoises showed clear "varieties", all closely related to one another, and to the mainland, as they adapted to local conditions (*species are not fixed!*)
    - When he sent these back to experts, they told him they were all different species!  
    - Could species, like the geology, be slowly changing in response to forces acting now?  
- When he returned, became very interested in how humans have changed organisms under domestication: **artificial selection** `[see slides]`  
  - Species can clearly change dramatically if breeding is directed to do so  
  - Species in nature clearly change in response to different conditions...but how? (what is the driving force?)  
- In 1838 read an essay by an economist named **Thomas Malthus**  
  - "The power of the population [to reproduce] is infinitely greater
than the power of the earth to produce subsistence for man."  
  - The human population is kept in check by things like disease, famine, and death.  
  - Darwin recognized that this power was even stronger in nature - had his mechanism: **natural selection**  
- By 1838, had his ideas largely formulated `[see slide]`  
- Why did he wait so long to publish? (*Origin* published in 1859)
  - Issues with religion  
  - Continued to gain evidence and refine thinking  
  - Communicated his ideas with several colleagues
- Suggested reading `[see slide]`


**Alfred Russell Wallace:**  
- Also a British naturalist  
- Was inspired by other naturalists (including Darwin) and in 1848 began a trip to the Amazon  
- In 1854, started and 8-year journey around the Malay Archipelago collecting specimens from a large number of islands `[see slides]`  
- Noticed/documented many patterns:  
  - Wallace's line `[see slides]`  
  - Similar to Darwin, based no variations he found across different islands, became clear that species change over time (saw similar patters across a wide range of organisms)  
- On his own, developed the idea of a "tree of life"
- Suffering from a severe fever, with nothing to do but thing, he also developed the idea of natural selection (also based on the writings of Malthus)
- Wrote up his ideas and sent them to many people, including Darwin
- Forced Darwin's hand to publish the *Origin*
