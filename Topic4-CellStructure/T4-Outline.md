# Outline for Day #4 - Cell Structure

## Goals For The Day
1. Understand where cells fit in the structure of life
2. Understand the structure of the cellular membrane and how that allows selective permeability of cells in order to maintain internal homeostasis


## Main Topics
1. **Cells are the basic unit of life**  
  - Show tree of life  
    - Highlight single-celled organisms and multicellular organisms  
  - In multicellular organisms, are the basic unit of organization  
    - Show image of cell -> tissue -> organ -> organism

2. **Cellular Membrane**  
  1. Function  
    - Control what goes in and out
    - Maintain internal conditions (homeostasis)  
  2. Structure
    - Like dissolves like & discussion of hydrophobic vs hydrophilic
    - Phospholipid bilayer
    - Proteins
    - Fluid mosaic model

3. **Two main types of cells**  
  1. Describe prokarotic and eukaryotic cells  
    - No nucleus or membrane-bound organelles vs nucleus and membrane-bound organelles  
    - Show relationship and relative proportions of each (tree)  
  2. Explain the thoughts on the evolution of eukaryotes via symbiosis
