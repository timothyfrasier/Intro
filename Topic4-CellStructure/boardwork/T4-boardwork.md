# Board work for Topic #4 - Cell Structure

## Supplies
1. 2 bottles with oil and colored water mixture
2. Detergent
3. Bottle with just water
4. Food colouring drops


### How Detergents Work

`[Frame 11]`  
- Explain how micelles work to make hydrophobic molecules soluble in water
- **Demonstration** with water and oil


### Role of Cholesterol
`[Frame 17]`  
**Problem:** How to maintain membrane structure in varying conditions  
  - Too hot and membrane molecules will split apart, breaking open cell  
  - Too cold and membrane will solidify, making it rigid and influencing function  
  - Discuss effects of branching patterns  
  - Cholesterol keeps membrane in a "goldilocks" level of viscosity  
    - At high temperatures, decreases viscosity based on tail interactions with other tails  
    - At low temperatures, keeps fluid by blocking close association with phospholipid molecules  
   - Maintains relatively constant membrane viscosity under a range of temperatures.


### Diffusion
`[Frame 23]`  
- Demonstrate diffusion by adding a drop of food colouring into a beaker of water

`[Frame 25]`
- Explain/draw how small non-polar molecules can diffuse across the plasma Membrane


### Osmosis
`[Frame 28]`  
- Define:  
  - **Hypotonic:** solute [ ] higher inside cell than in environment  
  - **Isotonic:** solute [ ] same inside cell as in environment  
  - **Hypertonic:** solute [ ] lower inside cell than in environment


### Facilitated diffusion  
`[Frame 30]`  
- Still passive transport - Does not require energy  
- Required for molecules that can't pass easily through the plasma membrane  
  - Polar or charged molecules (e.g., water!)  
  - Large molecules


### Case Study, Lynn Margulis
`[Frame 27]`  
- Started college at just 16  
- Met Carl Sagan, who triggered her interest in science  

`[Frame 28]`  
- Were married when she was 19 and he was 22  
- Carl got a Ph.D. position in Wisconsin, so Lynn applied for, and was accepted into a Master's program at University of Wisconsin  
- Was there in Madison that she got interested in the potential symbiotic origin of mitochondria

`[Frame 29]`
- Had 2 kids (on Carl's schedule, in 1959 & 1960) while doing her Master's Work  
- Carl received a fellowship at University of California, Berkeley, so Lynne applied for, and was accepted into a Ph.D. program there.  

`[Frame 30]`  
- Realized that tackling the symbiosis question would require the synthesis of genetics, zoology, and paleontology. However, people in these fields didn't communicate much with each other.  
- She tried to synthesize it all on her own  
- Got divorced in 1964  
- Carl was offered a position at Harvard, and she moved to Boston so that the kids would be close to their father (even though they were divorced and she had not yet completed her Ph.D.)  

`[Frame 31]`
- Finished her Ph.D. and taught part-time in Boston  
- She synthesized her own work, with that of others, to develop a unified symbiotic theory for the evolution of eukaryotes.
- Was not her original idea, but she was the chief explainer and defender of it
- Was rejected from 15 journals, then finally published in **1967**, but many people were still skeptical
- It was not until **1975** when DNA sequence data strongly supported the symbiosis idea that her work became widely accepted
- She has since won many awards

`[Frame 32]`
- In **2000** the National Medal of Science


### Inner Membrane System
`[Frame 57]`
Tying this all together:
  - DNA codes for proteins, these proteins are originally synthesized in the rough ER  
  - These proteins often need quite a bit of modification before they are functional, which can take place in the different phases of the ER  
  - In Golgi body, get finalized (added to other proteins, carbohydrates, etc.) then transported around the cell


### Vesicles
`[Frame 58]`
- Explain that all of these membranes are made of phospholipid bilayers, and can therefore fuse, bud off, etc. as needed  
- This is how things get transported around the cell  
- Transport "bubbles" are called **vesicles**
